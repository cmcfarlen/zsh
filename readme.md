# My zsh setup

For when I forget how this all works later in life.

Setup: link `~/.zshenv -> ~/.config/zsh/.zshenv`

## Files

`.zshenv`

For environment variables used by everything.

`.zprofile`

auto sourced for login shells *BEFORE* .zshrc.  Setup environment for cli utilities, etc.

`.zshrc`

auto sourced for interactive shells.  Setup look and feel.
